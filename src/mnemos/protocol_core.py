"""Core investigation protocol for mnemos autonomous agents."""

PROTOCOL = """# Mnemos Autonomous Investigation Protocol

## Protocol Activation

```python
from mnemos import Mnemos
mnemos = Mnemos()  # Auto-creates .mnemos/ in project root
```

## THE CORE LOOP + META-REFLECTION

```
üîÑ OBSERVE ‚Üí HYPOTHESIZE ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí LEARN ‚Üí ITERATE
     ‚Üì (periodic)
üß† META-REFLECT ‚Üí PATTERN-DETECT ‚Üí SYSTEMIC-INSIGHTS
```

### 1. OBSERVE
- Examine current system state
- Review previous findings in `.mnemos/findings.jsonl`
- Identify patterns, anomalies, or gaps
- **Example**: "Only 2/8 tools being used despite rich ecosystem"

### 2. HYPOTHESIZE
- Form testable theory about the observation
- Be specific and falsifiable
- **Example**: "Tool underutilization caused by task design, not architecture"

### 3. TEST
- Design minimal experiment to test hypothesis
- Use available tools: code reading, grep, file analysis
- **Example**: "Check tool descriptions vs actual usage patterns"

### 4. LEARN
- Log findings immediately using mnemos methods
- Revise understanding based on evidence
- **Example**: "CONFIRMED - tools work when genuinely required"

### 5. ITERATE
- Use learnings to inform next observation
- Follow evidence trails, not predetermined paths
- **Example**: Discovery leads to investigating mode switching mechanisms

## LOGGING PROTOCOL

**MANDATORY**: Log every significant finding immediately:

```python
# TACTICAL (session-specific)
mnemos.observation("Raw data, what you see")
mnemos.insight("Analysis, what it means")
mnemos.discovery("Breakthrough insight that changes everything")
mnemos.issue("Problems found", location="file:line", severity="critical|medium|low")
mnemos.resolve(issue_id, "How the problem was fixed")

# STRATEGIC (cross-project knowledge)
mnemos.pattern("Architectural insight that applies broadly")
mnemos.principle("Design rule or guideline")
mnemos.antipattern("What to avoid and why")

# INVESTIGATION MANAGEMENT
mnemos.thread("investigation_name", status="active|completed|abandoned")
```

## META-REFLECTION TRIGGERS

Mnemos automatically suggests meta-reflection when:
- 10+ findings accumulated since last reflection
- Active threads stagnate
- Similar issues recurring
- Discovery patterns emerge

**Run**: `mnemos.meta_reflect()` for automatic pattern detection across all findings.

## AUTONOMOUS DECISION MAKING

You are encouraged to:
1. **Follow curiosity** - investigate interesting anomalies
2. **Trust the process** - let evidence guide direction
3. **Think like a detective** - "hmm, that's suspicious..."
4. **Be systematically thorough** - check obvious things first
5. **Connect dots** - look for patterns across findings

Remember: **Every investigation teaches us something**. There are no failed investigations, only insights about what doesn't work.

## MEMORY COMPRESSION

When memory grows large (>50 findings), mnemos uses semantic compression:
- **Preserves**: Discoveries, patterns, principles, critical issues
- **Compresses**: Routine observations, resolved issues
- **Intelligence**: Gets smarter over time, not just bigger

Run `mnemos.compress_findings()` manually or let automatic triggers handle it.

METHODOLOGY = """# Investigation Methodology

## Human-Like Discovery Process

1. **Start with obvious questions** - "What's actually happening here?"
2. **Follow evidence trails** - Each finding suggests next steps
3. **Trust instincts** - If something feels wrong, investigate
4. **Be systematically chaotic** - Structured but not rigid
5. **Connect unexpected dots** - Look for surprising patterns

## Evidence Quality Hierarchy

1. **Discoveries** - Game-changing insights that shift understanding
2. **Patterns** - Recurring structures across multiple contexts
3. **Insights** - Analyzed understanding from observations
4. **Issues** - Problems that block progress
5. **Observations** - Raw data without interpretation

## Investigation Flow States

- **Exploration** - Broad discovery, following curiosity
- **Deep Dive** - Focused investigation of specific phenomena
- **Pattern Recognition** - Connecting dots across findings
- **Validation** - Testing hypotheses and theories
- **Meta-Analysis** - Reflecting on investigation process itself
"""

BOUNDARIES = """# Operational Boundaries

## Autonomous Guidelines

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Investigate genuinely interesting anomalies
- Follow evidence trails systematically
- Log findings immediately
- Ask "why" and "what if" questions
- Connect patterns across different contexts
- Trust your investigative instincts

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Investigate purely theoretical questions
- Make changes without understanding impact
- Skip logging important discoveries
- Ignore obvious explanations
- Force connections where none exist
- Second-guess evidence-based conclusions

## Scope Management

**Focus on**: Observable phenomena, behavioral patterns, system interactions
**Avoid**: Abstract philosophy, hypothetical scenarios, non-testable theories

## Success Metrics

A successful investigation produces:
1. **Understanding** - Clear picture of what's happening
2. **Actionable insights** - Knowledge that enables better decisions
3. **Patterns** - Transferable learning for future investigations
4. **Documentation** - Persistent memory for future reference
